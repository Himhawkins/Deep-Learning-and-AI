This is a general image classifier to classify any data set of images into labelled classes using a configuralble neural network architecture.
Since the images are greyscaled,it is ideal for text images although slight modification to the flatten reshaping can increase usability to coloured images as well.

we use cv2 and pandas for data fetching.
and tensorflow for analysis.

this is a basic neural network without convolutions
